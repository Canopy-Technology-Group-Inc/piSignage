## What is PiSignage? 

PiSignage is a very popular Digital Signage Solution primarily used along with Raspberry Pi boards (but can also 
work on other Linux based hardware platforms,for e.g. Intel NUC, see [here](https://pisignage.com/releases/Player2_installation_procedure.html)). 
In addition, piSignage is also available on [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pisignage.player2&hl=en&gl=US) and as an [web 
app](https://pisignage.com/player2/)  

All Raspberry Pi models are supported (please use specific image for the various models as mentioned [below](https://github.com/colloqi/piSignage#getting-the-player-ready)).

Raspberry Pi connects to TV through HDMI interface and needs network connectivity to reach pisignage.com or any 
other piSignage server locally configured. 

PiSignage players can be managed centrally using managed services at [pisignage.com](https://pisignage.com) or using a 
separate server using [open sourced server software](https://github.com/colloqi/pisignage-server) or independently using player webUI (http://player-ip:8000).   

**Managing Screens is just a few steps**
 
1. **Upload images/videos**, provide web or streaming links, design and upload HTML assets as a zip file  
2. **Create playlists** by selecting one of the built-in layouts or custom layouts created using the template designer,
   add assets(drag and rearrange for the desired order), enter duration of play for each asset. You can also add a ticker feed and 
   define special playlists for adverts insertion, domination content, lounge music and content play based on events  
3. **Create Groups and assign players** to a group which needs to play the same playlists. Then you can assign and schedule multiple 
    playlists to a group. You can also define display settings, schedule TV on/off and other properties of the group. 
   Whenever ready, Deploy playlists at the 
    click of a button to all the players in the group.  
4. You can **centrally monitor the players** in the dashboard/player screens,view current snapshot of TV, get reports, update software 
    and also issue debug piShell commands.  

**More functions and utilities**

1. You can play/pause playlists, play individual assets from both player and server UIs.
2. Players can operate in kiosk mode pointing to the URL provided and play normal playlists when no key is pressed.
3. Autoconfiguration of players and many such features for bulk management of players.
